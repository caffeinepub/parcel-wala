  "summary": "Most requested frontend/backend changes appear implemented: Sign Up flow (modal + backend persistence + migration), horizontal tab transitions with reduced-motion support, INR currency icon/text updates in several places, Send Parcel travel-mode removal with default mode, Profile photo local upload/preview, Offer Trip tab presence, and branding text updates. One requirement (REQ-35 asset addition) is not evidenced in the diff summary. Additionally, the bottom tab bar was altered to only 5 tabs, which was not requested and conflicts with the stated non-goal about not changing the overall tab architecture beyond adding Offer Trip.",

      "reason": "HomePage was updated to reference /assets/generated/home-hero-photo-pacel-wala.dim_1200x600.jpg, but the diff summary does not show any new image file added under frontend/public/assets/generated, so the asset addition portion of the requirement is not evidenced.",
